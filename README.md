# Svelte + Vite + Tailwind CSS + Daisy UI

This is a sample repo with [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/) setup with [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/), [tailwindcss](https://tailwindcss.com/), and [daisyUI](https://daisyui.com/). Tailwind typography plugin is also included.

Currently the daisyUI theme is set to *corporate*. You can change it by changing *data-theme* in the `index.html` file, e.g. `<html lang="en" data-theme="cupcake">`, see [daisyUI themes](https://daisyui.com/docs/themes/) for details.
